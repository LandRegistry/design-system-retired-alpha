    <p><strong>API's</strong>: Public, private and internal APIs - the schemas and example data to get information from, submit to - to test intefaces to existing infrastructural components</p>

    <p><strong>Third party interfaces</strong>: interface schemas and example data to get realistic sample data from, and sumbit to, third party test components and services.  like notifications, payments, licensed conveyancers, marriage register</p>

    <p><strong>Machine learning</strong>: Machine learning, AI, algorithms, sample data and models to test and explore what our machine learning tools can do</p>
